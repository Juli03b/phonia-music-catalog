### Features
 Phonia was created to make finding similar music easier and faster. Just find the song you want to find similar music for.  
 Create an account to add music to your favorites, create playlists, and track your favorite songs and genres. These features are for the purpose of tracking your favorite music and similar music, making it easier to find plenty of similar songs and come back to them later.  

 ### User Flow
 At the home page, the main attraction is the search bar to find songs or artists. After searching for a song or an artist, click on the result you were searching for.  
 If it's a song, you will see the album cover (along with extra photos), the song title, artist name, and other metadata. Some songs include lyrics and/or artist links. An artist link will take yout to a page with the artist's most popular music. At the homepage you also see the three most popular songs and a link to see all 20.  
 The navbar includes sign in and register links. The signup page includes three fields that must be filled out: username, password, and name. The username must be at least 3 characters and 15 at most. When logged in, the links include: Favorites, playlists, profile, and signout. Favorites will take you to a page with all of your favorited songs, where you can go to the song's page. Playlists will take you to a page with all of your playlists, and you can also create one here.
